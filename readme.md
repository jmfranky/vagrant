Create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments. [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) is an amazing tool for managing virtual machines via a simple to use command line interface.



## Install

Vagrant uses [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to manage the virtual dependencies. You can [directly download virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and install or use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) for it.

```shell
$ brew cask install virtualbox
```

Now install Vagrant either [from the website](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) or use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) for installing it.

```shell
$ brew cask install vagrant
```

## Configure

Besides the configurations listed above there are also many other install scripts available here: [https://github.com/stfnhh/vagrant-provisioning-scripts](https://github.com/stfnhh/vagrant-provisioning-scripts)
